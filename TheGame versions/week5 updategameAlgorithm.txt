If the ball moves down on the screen perform potential paddle collision
	Get actual distance between the mBall and the ball being checked

	Check if the actual distance is lower than the allowed => collision
		Get the present velocity
		Change the direction of the ball
		Get the velocity after the collision
		using the fraction between the original velocity and present velocity 
		to calculate the needed speeds in X and Y to get the original velocity but with the new angle.
		


Move the ball's X and Y using the speed (pixel/sec)


Check if the ball hits either the left side or the right side of the screen
But only do something if the ball is moving towards that side of the screen
	change the direction of the ball in the X direction

Get distance between red ball and smiley ball
Check if the actual distance is lower than the allowed => collision
	Get the present velocity
	Change the direction of the ball
	Get the velocity after the collision
	using the fraction between the original velocity and present velocity 
	to calculate the needed speeds in X and Y to get the original velocity but with the new angle.
	increas score

Loop through all SadBalls
	Perform collisions (if necessary) between SadBall in current position and the red ball

	Get actual distance between the mBall and the ball being checked

	Check if the actual distance is lower than the allowed => collision
		Get the present velocity
		Change the direction of the ball
		Get the velocity after the collision
		using the fraction between the original velocity and present velocity 
		to calculate the needed speeds in X and Y to get the original velocity but with the new angle.

If the ball goes out of the top of the screen and moves towards the top of the screen
	change the direction of the ball in the Y direction

If the ball goes out of the bottom of the screen
	lose the game
